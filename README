Crawl images from galleries(article board) in dcinside.com.
This is perl version. please see dcmon.py for python version.

This script is originally written with python, but changed to perl.

This script doesn't requires any modules.
But, I'm plan to use some modules like WWW:Mechanize, to collect more effectively.

If you need perl-bundled executable, install par from CPAN;

usages is simple.
1. edit dcmon.cfg(give a proper gallery name per each line)
(if you need names of galleries then visit dcinside.com)
2. run dcmon.pl.
